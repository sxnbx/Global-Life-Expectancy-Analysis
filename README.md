# Global-Life-Expectancy-Analysis

## Project Overview
This data analysis and exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focuses on a comprehensive cleaning and investigation of a global life expectancy dataset. Utilizing SQL data cleaning techniques and advanced querying, the project uncovers vital insights into life expectancy trends, health indicators, and socioeconomic factors across countries and years. The clean dataset and analytical findings provide a foundation for impactful data-driven decision making in healthcare and policy.

### Tools & Technologies
- SQL (MySQL) for data cleaning, manipulation, and querying
- Techniques: Data cleaning, missing data imputation, window functions, aggregation, conditional logic
- Dataset: world_life_expectancy with attributes such as Country, Year, Life expectancy, GDP, BMI, Adult Mortality, and Status

## Objectives
- Perform data cleaning by identifying and removing duplicates and imputing missing values in critical variables such as Status and Life expectancy.
- Conduct data preprocessing to ensure dataset integrity and readiness for analysis.
- Explore life expectancy trends and variability globally over the past 15 years.
- Analyze correlations between life expectancy and key factors like GDP, BMI, and adult mortality.
- Compare health outcomes by country development status, leveraging SQL analytics and data aggregation.
- Generate actionable insights for health researchers, policymakers, and business analysts.

## Summary / Key Findings
- Significant improvements in life expectancy observed in several countries over the past 15 years, with some nations showing increases of over 10 years.
- The global average life expectancy has risen steadily, approximately 6 years over the studied period, indicating overall health progress worldwide.
- There is a positive correlation between GDP and life expectancy â€” wealthier countries tend to have higher life expectancy, confirming socioeconomic influence on health outcomes.
- Countries classified as Developed show higher average life expectancy compared to Developing nations, highlighting disparities linked to economic and healthcare infrastructure.
- Analysis of BMI and adult mortality rates reveals important health risk patterns that could influence life expectancy trends.
- Use of advanced SQL window functions enables detailed temporal analysis of mortality trends, illustrating the cumulative impact over time.
